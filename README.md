## Static Image Face Detection:

The static image face detection module allows users to detect faces in a single image file. It utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms to identify and draw rectangles around detected faces.

## Webcam Face Detection:

With the webcam face detection feature, users can perform real-time face detection using their computer's webcam. The system captures frames from the webcam feed and applies face detection algorithms to identify and mark faces.

## Recorded Video Face Detection:

This module enables face detection in pre-recorded video files. Users can input a video file, and the system will process each frame to detect faces, providing visual feedback with rectangles around the detected faces.

## Web Application for Face Detection:

The web application component of this repository allows users to upload a recorded video file and view it alongside another video displaying the same content with face detection overlay. This feature is particularly useful for visualizing face detection results in a user-friendly interface.

## Installation:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DiaUdeshi/Face-Detection

3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Ensure you have a compatible version of Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).
